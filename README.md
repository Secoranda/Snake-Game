# Event-driven Programming (PPE) Laboratory Work #5


## Team:

- Bantus Vladislav

- Chirosca Ariadna

- Gore Polina

- Cojocari Daniela


## Purpose

- Collaboration

- Complex application


## Requirements

#### Mandatory Objectives

- Create an application which has:
  
   + Child windows controls
  
   + GDI animation
  
- Animation should be controlled by user input


#### Objectives with Points

- Work on this project in a team of 2-4 `(2 pt)`

   + Divide tasks and describe them in readme (for each task indicate who is responsible for it) `(1 pt)`
   
   + Use pull requests in order to merge your code `(2 pt)`

- Make it useful (you may be asked (by me) to evaluate the usefulness of your application idea) `(0-3 pt)`

- First create a sketch, then work on code `(1 pt)` (commit sketches early)


## Implementation

_Implemented in C#_

### Theme - Snake Game

We decided to re-create the Snake game: a funny game that you can play when you're bored in order to improve your attention.

### Early Sketch (Tasks to implement):

- Snake movement and animation control (The Snake Class)

- Collision detection

- Food Generator

- Eat food and increase the score, snake size and velocity

- App design

- Add music

- Speed increases after 5 apples eaten

- Pause/Restart commands (keyboard input)

- Add levels (with obstacles)

### Divided Tasks

- Vlad : Basic Functionality (Snake Class, Movement Control, Basic Collisions)

- Arina : Food Creation, Bonus Food, GUI

- Polina : Add Levels

- Daniela : Remove Bugs, Add details and features


### Final Results

- We have an application with Animation and Movement Control

- The application was created by a team of 4 people `(2 pt)`

- The tasks were divided (look above) `(1 pt)`

- We used __Pull Requests__ to merge our code from different branches `(2 pt)`

- An early sketch was commited before we began to work on our assignments `(1 pt)`

### How it looks:

## Conclusions

In this laboratory work we learnt:

- To divide the tasks among ourselves in order to obtain a `working` application

- To work on a shared repository (creating branches, merging them, using pull requests and so on)

----

#### Total Points

- `(6 pt) + (0-3 pt)` - __Objectives with Points__ implemented + (The usefulness of our app)

- `(1 pt)` - Early submission
